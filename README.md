# imu_gnss_eskf

The project is to implement an ESKF algorithm to fuse IMU and GNSS data. The theory can be referred to [Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02508.pdf). Most of the implementation can be referred to [imu_gps_localization](https://github.com/ydsf16/imu_gps_localization). The test dataset can be referred to [EU](https://epan-utbm.github.io/utbm_robocar_dataset/).
